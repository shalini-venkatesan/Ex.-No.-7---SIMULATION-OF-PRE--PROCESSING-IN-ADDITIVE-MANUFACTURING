# Ex. No. 7 - SIMULATION OF PRE PROCESSING IN ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING
### DATE: 
## AIM:
### To simulate the Pre Processing for 3D printing.

## REQUIREMENTS:
### System - Windows 7 or higher, 1 GB RAM.

## PROCEDURE:
### Pre-processing encompasses the steps between design and printing. Process of 3D printing starts with designing in CAD. Then printer software slices 3D CAD file into layers. For each slice, the software converts the data into machine code that determines tool paths for the machine to follow. The various steps in pre-processing from design to printing are as follows:

### 1)	CAD File
### 2)	Conversion to STL a. Orientation b. Support Structure c. Slicing d. Path Planning

### 1. CAD File
### Every manufacturing process starts with the process of designing and as in any type of manufacturing, there are certain limitations to the materials and manufacturing processes that dictate how the product should be designed, 3D printing is no different. In 3d printing, characteristics of hardware, software, temperature, filament and many other factors play an important role in how a digital model translates into a printed object. Some of them are designed with a strong base, grain direction, overhung, wall thickness, round corners and tolerances.

### 2. Conversion to STL
### In order to check the interface of the object and make it reliable to 3d printers, conversion to STL file is required. It also facilitates other features like quick error check, bridging the gap between CAD platforms, exhibition purposes and 3D digitizer extension.

### a. Orientation:
### Orientation plays a vital role in the final product of 3d printing as it affects the part accuracy, manufacturing time, strength and surface finish. There are various orientations by which we can print the object such as vertically upward, vertically downward and in horizontal plane.

### b. Support Structure:
### Support structures are required where the objects are unable to get printed directly. Support structures help to guarantee the printability of a section during the 3D printing measure and also it can assist with forestalling part twisting, secure a section to the printing bed and guarantee that parts are joined to the fundamental body of the printed part.

### c. Slicing:
### The motive behind slicing a 3D model is to transform the model into guidelines for the 3D printer. To play out this errand, the slicing software isolates the item into numerous layers. It's classified "slicing" since it "slices" the 3D model to make numerous layers. After the layers have been made, the slicing software applies different qualities to every one of them.

### d. Path Planning:
### Path planning helps to improve the printed surface quality, shape accuracy and infill distribution quality. There are various ways for path planning which can be used to print the objects which may affect the following factors in objects like raster path, grid path, spiral path and zigzag path.

### ●	All the processes related to pre-processing will be shown on the screen.
### ●	Select CAD file preparation from the visible list.
### ●	When the first process is selected then it will open in the blank space in the left side of the screen.
### ●	Select the options of process of pre-processing in the sequence in which they are shown.
### ●	If the user follows an incorrect sequence then a pop-up will appear on the screen showing the name of the process to be selected.

During the pre-processing stage for 3D printing, the CAD file serves as the input for further preparation and optimization
before sending it to the 3D printer.The CAD file contains the complete design intent, including the geometry, features, 
and other details necessary for the 3D printing process.

### 2. Conversion to STL

In the simulation of pre-processing for 3D printing, "Conversion to STL" refers to the process of exporting or saving the 3D model in the 
STL (Standard Tessellation Language) file format. STL is one of the most common file formats used in 3D printing due to its simplicity 
and compatibility with a wide range of 3D printers.

### a. Orientation:

 "Orientation" refers to the adjustment of the 3D model's position or alignment in order to optimize 
 its printability and achieve the desired printing outcome.
 
### b. Support Structure:

"Support Structure" refers to the generation of additional structures that provide support to overhanging or delicate
parts of the 3D model during the printing process.

### c. Slicing:

"Slicing" refers to the process of converting a 3D model into a series of 2D layers that the 3D printer can understand and print.
Slicing involves dividing the model into thin horizontal layers and generating the necessary instructions for the printer
to recreate each layer.

### d. Path Planning:
![ex7 6](https://github.com/AsinVardhini/Ex.-No.-7---SIMULATION-OF-PRE--PROCESSING-IN-ADDITIVE-MANUFACTURING/assets/119417735/1ad7d639-b9fb-4330-a5c7-7094a79f7039)

"Path Planning" refers to the process of determining the optimal toolpath or movement trajectory for the 
3D printer's nozzle or extruder during the printing process. Path planning involves calculating the most
efficient and precise pathsto follow for printing each layer of the 3D model.

## Result: 
### Thus the simulation on the Preprocessing in additive manufacturing is completed.
